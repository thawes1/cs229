Stanford's CS229 Machine Learning course (2018) by Andrew Ng can be viewed [on YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&ab_channel=StanfordOnline)

The problem sets for the course can be found [here] (https://github.com/maxim5/cs229-2018-autumn)

This repository is an in-progress compilation of my solutions to the problem sets as I work through the course.
